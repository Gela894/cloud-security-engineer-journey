## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- SecureNext Technologies is developing "DataVault Lite," a lightweight data storage and management solution. Unlike its larger sibling, DataVault, this version is optimized for fast deployment and scalability
  utilizing a 2-Tier architecture:

  * Web/Application Layer: Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in private subnets

  * Database Layer: Amazon RDS (MySQL) with Multi-AZ deployment

- The infrastructure must be highly secure, monitored for real-time threats, and designed with AWS best practices. You have been tasked with architecting and securing the entire stack.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Security by Design: Implement security at every layer (network, application, and data).

- Monitoring and Logging: Enable real-time threat detection and centralized logging.

- Compliance and Visibility: Ensure the architecture meets compliance standards (e.g., CIS, NIST).

- Threat Detection and Response: Set up alerts for potential threats and vulnerabilities.
